# SDE-Interview-Questions

## A repo for maintaining a list of the technical as well as behavioral questions asked in software companies

- There is no restriction to the choice of programming language but for solutions in two or more languages to a question, place them in separate directories.
- The behavioral questions should be placed in separate folder company-wise.

## Guidelines
- First open an issue and get assigned before submitting the PR
- The contributions will be merged after review and modifications as needed
